# Vigenere-Cipher
THIS CODE IS WRITTEN USING PYTHON

This is my attempt at coding a Vigenere Cipher. The user chooses a keyword to give to the program along with a sentence, and then the program encrypts said sentence. 
I plan to include addtional work to include a decrypt function for users.

The updated Vignere Cipher includes a decryption function, and I recreated the program to work with the library imports tkinter and messagebox. I'm keeping my old version of the Python file because I want to see the process I've made as I work on my coding.
